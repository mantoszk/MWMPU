A color scale for use with color coding data such as \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_color_map}{Q\+C\+P\+Color\+Map}}.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
A color scale for use with color coding data such as \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_color_map}{Q\+C\+P\+Color\+Map}}. 

This layout element can be placed on the plot to correlate a color gradient with data values. It is usually used in combination with one or multiple \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_color_map}{Q\+C\+P\+Color\+Maps}}.



The color scale can be either horizontal or vertical, as shown in the image above. The orientation and the side where the numbers appear is controlled with set\+Type.

Use Q\+C\+P\+Color\+Map\+::set\+Color\+Scale to connect a color map with a color scale. Once they are connected, they share their gradient, data range and data scale type (set\+Gradient, set\+Data\+Range, set\+Data\+Scale\+Type). Multiple color maps may be associated with a single color scale, to make them all synchronize these properties.

To have finer control over the number display and axis behaviour, you can directly access the axis. See the documentation of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis}} for details about configuring axes. For example, if you want to change the number of automatically generated ticks, call 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 Placing a color scale next to the main axis rect works like with any other layout element\+: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
In this case we have placed it to the right of the default axis rect, so it wasn\textquotesingle{}t necessary to call set\+Type, since Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+::at\+Right is already the default. The text next to the color scale can be set with set\+Label.

For optimum appearance (like in the image above), it may be desirable to line up the axis rect and the borders of the color scale. Use a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_margin_group}{Q\+C\+P\+Margin\+Group}} to achieve this\+: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 Color scales are initialized with a non-\/zero minimum top and bottom margin (set\+Minimum\+Margins), because vertical color scales are most common and the minimum top/bottom margin makes sure it keeps some distance to the top/bottom widget border. So if you change to a horizontal color scale by setting set\+Type to Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+::at\+Bottom or Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+::at\+Top, you might want to also change the minimum margins accordingly, e.\+g. {\ttfamily set\+Minimum\+Margins(\+Q\+Margins(6, 0, 6, 0))}.
