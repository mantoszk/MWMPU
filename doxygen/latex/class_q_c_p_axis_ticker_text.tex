Specialized axis ticker which allows arbitrary labels at specified coordinates.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Specialized axis ticker which allows arbitrary labels at specified coordinates. 



This \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis_ticker}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Ticker}} subclass generates ticks which can be directly specified by the user as coordinates and associated strings. They can be passed as a whole with set\+Ticks or one at a time with add\+Tick. Alternatively you can directly access the internal storage via ticks and modify the tick/label data there.

This is useful for cases where the axis represents categories rather than numerical values.

If you are updating the ticks of this ticker regularly and in a dynamic fasion (e.\+g. dependent on the axis range), it is a sign that you should probably create an own ticker by subclassing \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis_ticker}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Ticker}}, instead of using this one.

The ticker can be created and assigned to an axis like this\+:
