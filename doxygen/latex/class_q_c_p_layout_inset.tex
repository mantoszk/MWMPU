A layout that places child elements aligned to the border or arbitrarily positioned.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
A layout that places child elements aligned to the border or arbitrarily positioned. 

Elements are placed either aligned to the border or at arbitrary position in the area of the layout. Which placement applies is controlled with the Inset\+Placement (set\+Inset\+Placement).

Elements are added via add\+Element(\+Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Element $\ast$element, Qt\+::\+Alignment alignment) or add\+Element(\+Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Element $\ast$element, const Q\+Rect\+F \&rect). If the first method is used, the inset placement will default to ip\+Border\+Aligned and the element will be aligned according to the {\itshape alignment} parameter. The second method defaults to ip\+Free and allows placing elements at arbitrary position and size, defined by {\itshape rect}.

The alignment or rect can be set via set\+Inset\+Alignment or set\+Inset\+Rect, respectively.

This is the layout that every \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis_rect}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Rect}} has as Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Rect\+::inset\+Layout.
