Specialized axis ticker with a fixed tick step.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Specialized axis ticker with a fixed tick step. 



This \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis_ticker}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Ticker}} subclass generates ticks with a fixed tick step set with set\+Tick\+Step. It is also possible to allow integer multiples and integer powers of the specified tick step with set\+Scale\+Strategy.

A typical application of this ticker is to make an axis only display integers, by setting the tick step of the ticker to 1.\+0 and the scale strategy to ss\+Multiples.

Another case is when a certain number has a special meaning and axis ticks should only appear at multiples of that value. In this case you might also want to consider \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis_ticker_pi}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Ticker\+Pi}} because despite the name it is not limited to only pi symbols/values.

The ticker can be created and assigned to an axis like this\+:
