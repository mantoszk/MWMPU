The abstract base class for paint buffers, which define the rendering backend.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
The abstract base class for paint buffers, which define the rendering backend. 

This abstract base class defines the basic interface that a paint buffer needs to provide in order to be usable by \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}}.

A paint buffer manages both a surface to draw onto, and the matching paint device. The size of the surface can be changed via set\+Size. External classes (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layer}{Q\+C\+P\+Layer}}) request a painter via start\+Painting and then perform the draw calls. Once the painting is complete, done\+Painting is called, so the paint buffer implementation can do clean up if necessary. Before rendering a frame, each paint buffer is usually filled with a color using clear (usually the color is {\ttfamily Qt\+::transparent}), to remove the contents of the previous frame.

The simplest paint buffer implementation is \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_paint_buffer_pixmap}{Q\+C\+P\+Paint\+Buffer\+Pixmap}} which allows regular software rendering via the raster engine. Hardware accelerated rendering via pixel buffers and frame buffer objects is provided by Q\+C\+P\+Paint\+Buffer\+Gl\+Pbuffer and Q\+C\+P\+Paint\+Buffer\+Gl\+Fbo. They are used automatically if Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::set\+Open\+Gl is enabled.
