Specialized axis ticker to display ticks in units of an arbitrary constant, for example pi.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Specialized axis ticker to display ticks in units of an arbitrary constant, for example pi. 



This \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis_ticker}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Ticker}} subclass generates ticks that are expressed with respect to a given symbolic constant with a numerical value specified with set\+Pi\+Value and an appearance in the tick labels specified with set\+Pi\+Symbol.

Ticks may be generated at fractions of the symbolic constant. How these fractions appear in the tick label can be configured with set\+Fraction\+Style.

The ticker can be created and assigned to an axis like this\+:
