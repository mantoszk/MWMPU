Responsible for drawing the grid of a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis}}.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Responsible for drawing the grid of a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis}}. 

This class is tightly bound to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis}}. Every axis owns a grid instance and uses it to draw the grid lines, sub grid lines and zero-\/line. You can interact with the grid of an axis via Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+::grid. Normally, you don\textquotesingle{}t need to create an instance of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_grid}{Q\+C\+P\+Grid}} yourself.

The axis and grid drawing was split into two classes to allow them to be placed on different layers (both \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_grid}{Q\+C\+P\+Grid}} inherit from \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layerable}{Q\+C\+P\+Layerable}}). Thus it is possible to have the grid in the background and the axes in the foreground, and any plottables/items in between. This described situation is the default setup, see the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layer}{Q\+C\+P\+Layer}} documentation. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
cpp/\mbox{\hyperlink{qcustomplot_8cpp}{qcustomplot.\+cpp}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
