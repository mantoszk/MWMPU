A layout that arranges child elements in a grid.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
A layout that arranges child elements in a grid. 

Elements are laid out in a grid with configurable stretch factors (set\+Column\+Stretch\+Factor, set\+Row\+Stretch\+Factor) and spacing (set\+Column\+Spacing, set\+Row\+Spacing).

Elements can be added to cells via add\+Element. The grid is expanded if the specified row or column doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist yet. Whether a cell contains a valid layout element can be checked with has\+Element, that element can be retrieved with element. If rows and columns that only have empty cells shall be removed, call simplify. Removal of elements is either done by just adding the element to a different layout or by using the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout}} interface take or remove.

If you use add\+Element(\+Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Element$\ast$) without explicit parameters for {\itshape row} and {\itshape column}, the grid layout will choose the position according to the current set\+Fill\+Order and the wrapping (set\+Wrap).

Row and column insertion can be performed with insert\+Row and insert\+Column.
