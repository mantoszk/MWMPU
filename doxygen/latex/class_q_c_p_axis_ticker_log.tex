Specialized axis ticker suited for logarithmic axes.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Specialized axis ticker suited for logarithmic axes. 



This \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis_ticker}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Ticker}} subclass generates ticks with unequal tick intervals suited for logarithmic axis scales. The ticks are placed at powers of the specified log base (set\+Log\+Base).

Especially in the case of a log base equal to 10 (the default), it might be desirable to have tick labels in the form of powers of ten without mantissa display. To achieve this, set the number precision (Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+::set\+Number\+Precision) to zero and the number format (Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+::set\+Number\+Format) to scientific (exponential) display with beautifully typeset decimal powers, so a format string of {\ttfamily \char`\"{}eb\char`\"{}}. This will result in the following axis tick labels\+:



The ticker can be created and assigned to an axis like this\+:
