Handles the different ending decorations for line-\/like items.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Handles the different ending decorations for line-\/like items. 

 For every ending a line-\/like item has, an instance of this class exists. For example, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_item_line}{Q\+C\+P\+Item\+Line}} has two endings which can be set with Q\+C\+P\+Item\+Line\+::set\+Head and Q\+C\+P\+Item\+Line\+::set\+Tail.

The styles themselves are defined via the enum Q\+C\+P\+Line\+Ending\+::\+Ending\+Style. Most decorations can be modified regarding width and length, see set\+Width and set\+Length. The direction of the ending decoration (e.\+g. direction an arrow is pointing) is controlled by the line-\/like item. For example, when both endings of a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_item_line}{Q\+C\+P\+Item\+Line}} are set to be arrows, they will point to opposite directions, e.\+g. \char`\"{}outward\char`\"{}. This can be changed by set\+Inverted, which would make the respective arrow point inward.

Note that due to the overloaded \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_line_ending}{Q\+C\+P\+Line\+Ending}} constructor, you may directly specify a Q\+C\+P\+Line\+Ending\+::\+Ending\+Style where actually a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_line_ending}{Q\+C\+P\+Line\+Ending}} is expected, e.\+g.
