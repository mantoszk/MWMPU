Holds multiple axes and arranges them in a rectangular shape.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Holds multiple axes and arranges them in a rectangular shape. 

This class represents an axis rect, a rectangular area that is bounded on all sides with an arbitrary number of axes.

Initially \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} has one axis rect, accessible via Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::axis\+Rect(). However, the layout system allows to have multiple axis rects, e.\+g. arranged in a grid layout (Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::plot\+Layout).

By default, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis_rect}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Rect}} comes with four axes, at bottom, top, left and right. They can be accessed via axis by providing the respective axis type (Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+::\+Axis\+Type) and index. If you need all axes in the axis rect, use axes. The top and right axes are set to be invisible initially (Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+::set\+Visible). To add more axes to a side, use add\+Axis or add\+Axes. To remove an axis, use remove\+Axis.

The axis rect layerable itself only draws a background pixmap or color, if specified (set\+Background). It is placed on the \char`\"{}background\char`\"{} layer initially (see \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layer}{Q\+C\+P\+Layer}} for an explanation of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} layer system). The axes that are held by the axis rect can be placed on other layers, independently of the axis rect.

Every axis rect has a child layout of type \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout_inset}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Inset}}. It is accessible via inset\+Layout and can be used to have other layout elements (or even other layouts with multiple elements) hovering inside the axis rect.

If an axis rect is clicked and dragged, it processes this by moving certain axis ranges. The behaviour can be controlled with set\+Range\+Drag and set\+Range\+Drag\+Axes. If the mouse wheel is scrolled while the cursor is on the axis rect, certain axes are scaled. This is controllable via set\+Range\+Zoom, set\+Range\+Zoom\+Axes and set\+Range\+Zoom\+Factor. These interactions are only enabled if Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::set\+Interactions contains Q\+C\+P\+::i\+Range\+Drag and Q\+C\+P\+::i\+Range\+Zoom.
