Groups multiple \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_bars}{Q\+C\+P\+Bars}} together so they appear side by side.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Groups multiple \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_bars}{Q\+C\+P\+Bars}} together so they appear side by side. 



When showing multiple \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_bars}{Q\+C\+P\+Bars}} in one plot which have bars at identical keys, it may be desirable to have them appearing next to each other at each key. This is what adding the respective \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_bars}{Q\+C\+P\+Bars}} plottables to a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_bars_group}{Q\+C\+P\+Bars\+Group}} achieves. (An alternative approach is to stack them on top of each other, see Q\+C\+P\+Bars\+::move\+Above.)\hypertarget{class_q_c_p_bars_group_qcpbarsgroup-usage}{}\subsection{Usage}\label{class_q_c_p_bars_group_qcpbarsgroup-usage}
To add a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_bars}{Q\+C\+P\+Bars}} plottable to the group, create a new group and then add the respective bars intances\+: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
Alternatively to appending to the group like shown above, you can also set the group on the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_bars}{Q\+C\+P\+Bars}} plottable via Q\+C\+P\+Bars\+::set\+Bars\+Group.

The spacing between the bars can be configured via set\+Spacing\+Type and set\+Spacing. The bars in this group appear in the plot in the order they were appended. To insert a bars plottable at a certain index position, or to reposition a bars plottable which is already in the group, use insert.

To remove specific bars from the group, use either remove or call Q\+C\+P\+Bars\+:\+:set\+Bars\+Group(0) on the respective bars plottable.

To clear the entire group, call clear, or simply delete the group.\hypertarget{class_q_c_p_bars_group_qcpbarsgroup-example}{}\subsection{Example}\label{class_q_c_p_bars_group_qcpbarsgroup-example}
