Represents the visual appearance of scatter points.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Represents the visual appearance of scatter points. 

This class holds information about shape, color and size of scatter points. In plottables like \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_graph}{Q\+C\+P\+Graph}} it is used to store how scatter points shall be drawn. For example, Q\+C\+P\+Graph\+::set\+Scatter\+Style takes a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_scatter_style}{Q\+C\+P\+Scatter\+Style}} instance.

A scatter style consists of a shape (set\+Shape), a line color (set\+Pen) and possibly a fill (set\+Brush), if the shape provides a fillable area. Further, the size of the shape can be controlled with set\+Size.\hypertarget{class_q_c_p_scatter_style_QCPScatterStyle-defining}{}\subsection{Specifying a scatter style}\label{class_q_c_p_scatter_style_QCPScatterStyle-defining}
You can set all these configurations either by calling the respective functions on an instance\+: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 Or you can use one of the various constructors that take different parameter combinations, making it easy to specify a scatter style in a single call, like so\+: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 \hypertarget{class_q_c_p_scatter_style_QCPScatterStyle-undefinedpen}{}\subsection{Leaving the color/pen up to the plottable}\label{class_q_c_p_scatter_style_QCPScatterStyle-undefinedpen}
There are two constructors which leave the pen undefined\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_scatter_style}{Q\+C\+P\+Scatter\+Style()}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_scatter_style}{Q\+C\+P\+Scatter\+Style(\+Scatter\+Shape shape, double size)}}. If those constructors are used, a call to is\+Pen\+Defined will return false. It leads to scatter points that inherit the pen from the plottable that uses the scatter style. Thus, if such a scatter style is passed to \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_graph}{Q\+C\+P\+Graph}}, the line color of the graph (Q\+C\+P\+Graph\+::set\+Pen) will be used by the scatter points. This makes it very convenient to set up typical scatter settings\+:

 Notice that it wasn\textquotesingle{}t even necessary to explicitly call a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_scatter_style}{Q\+C\+P\+Scatter\+Style}} constructor. This works because \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_scatter_style}{Q\+C\+P\+Scatter\+Style}} provides a constructor that can transform a Scatter\+Shape directly into a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_scatter_style}{Q\+C\+P\+Scatter\+Style}} instance (that\textquotesingle{}s the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_scatter_style}{Q\+C\+P\+Scatter\+Style(\+Scatter\+Shape shape, double size)}} constructor with a default for {\itshape size}). In those cases, C++ allows directly supplying a Scatter\+Shape, where actually a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_scatter_style}{Q\+C\+P\+Scatter\+Style}} is expected.\hypertarget{class_q_c_p_scatter_style_QCPScatterStyle-custompath-and-pixmap}{}\subsection{Custom shapes and pixmaps}\label{class_q_c_p_scatter_style_QCPScatterStyle-custompath-and-pixmap}
\mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_scatter_style}{Q\+C\+P\+Scatter\+Style}} supports drawing custom shapes and arbitrary pixmaps as scatter points.

For custom shapes, you can provide a Q\+Painter\+Path with the desired shape to the set\+Custom\+Path function or call the constructor that takes a painter path. The scatter shape will automatically be set to ss\+Custom.

For pixmaps, you call set\+Pixmap with the desired Q\+Pixmap. Alternatively you can use the constructor that takes a Q\+Pixmap. The scatter shape will automatically be set to ss\+Pixmap. Note that set\+Size does not influence the appearance of the pixmap.
