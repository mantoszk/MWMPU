Provides rect/rubber-\/band data selection and range zoom interaction.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Provides rect/rubber-\/band data selection and range zoom interaction. 

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_selection_rect}{Q\+C\+P\+Selection\+Rect}} is used by \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} when the Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::set\+Selection\+Rect\+Mode is not Q\+C\+P\+::srm\+None. When the user drags the mouse across the plot, the current selection rect instance (Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::set\+Selection\+Rect) is forwarded these events and makes sure an according rect shape is drawn. At the begin, during, and after completion of the interaction, it emits the corresponding signals started, changed, canceled, and accepted.

The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} instance connects own slots to the current selection rect instance, in order to react to an accepted selection rect interaction accordingly.

is\+Active can be used to check whether the selection rect is currently active. An ongoing selection interaction can be cancelled programmatically via calling cancel at any time.

The appearance of the selection rect can be controlled via set\+Pen and set\+Brush.

If you wish to provide custom behaviour, e.\+g. a different visual representation of the selection rect (Q\+C\+P\+Selection\+Rect\+::draw), you can subclass \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_selection_rect}{Q\+C\+P\+Selection\+Rect}} and pass an instance of your subclass to Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::set\+Selection\+Rect.
