A curved line from one point to another.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
A curved line from one point to another. 

 It has four positions, {\itshape start} and {\itshape end}, which define the end points of the line, and two control points which define the direction the line exits from the start and the direction from which it approaches the end\+: {\itshape start\+Dir} and {\itshape end\+Dir}.

With set\+Head and set\+Tail you may set different line ending styles, e.\+g. to create an arrow.

Often it is desirable for the control points to stay at fixed relative positions to the start/end point. This can be achieved by setting the parent anchor e.\+g. of {\itshape start\+Dir} simply to {\itshape start}, and then specify the desired pixel offset with Q\+C\+P\+Item\+Position\+::set\+Coords on {\itshape start\+Dir}.
