Specialized axis ticker for time spans in units of milliseconds to days.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Specialized axis ticker for time spans in units of milliseconds to days. 



This \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis_ticker}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Ticker}} subclass generates ticks that corresponds to time intervals.

The format of the time display in the tick labels is controlled with set\+Time\+Format and set\+Field\+Width. The time coordinate is in the unit of seconds with respect to the time coordinate zero. Unlike with \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis_ticker_date_time}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Ticker\+Date\+Time}}, the ticks don\textquotesingle{}t correspond to a specific calendar date and time.

The time can be displayed in milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours and days. Depending on the largest available unit in the format specified with set\+Time\+Format, any time spans above will be carried in that largest unit. So for example if the format string is \char`\"{}\%m\+:\%s\char`\"{} and a tick at coordinate value 7815 (being 2 hours, 10 minutes and 15 seconds) is created, the resulting tick label will show \char`\"{}130\+:15\char`\"{} (130 minutes, 15 seconds). If the format string is \char`\"{}\%h\+:\%m\+:\%s\char`\"{}, the hour unit will be used and the label will thus be \char`\"{}02\+:10\+:15\char`\"{}. Negative times with respect to the axis zero will carry a leading minus sign.

The ticker can be created and assigned to an axis like this\+:

 Here is an example of a time axis providing time information in days, hours and minutes. Due to the axis range spanning a few days and the wanted tick count (set\+Tick\+Count), the ticker decided to use tick steps of 12 hours\+:



The format string for this example is

If you rather wish to display calendar dates and times, have a look at \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis_ticker_date_time}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Ticker\+Date\+Time}} instead.
