A selection decorator which draws brackets around each selected data segment.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
A selection decorator which draws brackets around each selected data segment. 

Additionally to the regular highlighting of selected segments via color, fill and scatter style, this \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_selection_decorator}{Q\+C\+P\+Selection\+Decorator}} subclass draws markers at the begin and end of each selected data segment of the plottable.

The shape of the markers can be controlled with set\+Bracket\+Style, set\+Bracket\+Width and set\+Bracket\+Height. The color/fill can be controlled with set\+Bracket\+Pen and set\+Bracket\+Brush.

To introduce custom bracket styles, it is only necessary to sublcass \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_selection_decorator_bracket}{Q\+C\+P\+Selection\+Decorator\+Bracket}} and reimplement draw\+Bracket. The rest will be managed by the base class. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
