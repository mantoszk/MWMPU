A plottable representing a parametric curve in a plot.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
A plottable representing a parametric curve in a plot. 



Unlike \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_graph}{Q\+C\+P\+Graph}}, plottables of this type may have multiple points with the same key coordinate, so their visual representation can have {\itshape loops}. This is realized by introducing a third coordinate {\itshape t}, which defines the order of the points described by the other two coordinates {\itshape x} and {\itshape y}.

To plot data, assign it with the set\+Data or add\+Data functions. Alternatively, you can also access and modify the curve\textquotesingle{}s data via the data method, which returns a pointer to the internal Q\+C\+P\+Curve\+Data\+Container.

Gaps in the curve can be created by adding data points with NaN as key and value ({\ttfamily q\+Q\+Na\+N()} or {\ttfamily std\+::numeric\+\_\+limits$<$double$>$\+::quiet\+\_\+\+Na\+N()}) in between the two data points that shall be separated.\hypertarget{class_q_c_p_curve_qcpcurve-appearance}{}\subsection{Changing the appearance}\label{class_q_c_p_curve_qcpcurve-appearance}
The appearance of the curve is determined by the pen and the brush (set\+Pen, set\+Brush).\hypertarget{class_q_c_p_curve_qcpcurve-usage}{}\subsection{Usage}\label{class_q_c_p_curve_qcpcurve-usage}
Like all data representing objects in \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}}, the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_curve}{Q\+C\+P\+Curve}} is a plottable (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_abstract_plottable}{Q\+C\+P\+Abstract\+Plottable}}). So the plottable-\/interface of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} applies (Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::plottable, Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::remove\+Plottable, etc.)

Usually, you first create an instance\+: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
which registers it with the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} instance of the passed axes. Note that this \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} instance takes ownership of the plottable, so do not delete it manually but use Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::remove\+Plottable() instead. The newly created plottable can be modified, e.\+g.\+: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
