A plottable representing a financial stock chart.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
A plottable representing a financial stock chart. 



This plottable represents time series data binned to certain intervals, mainly used for stock charts. The two common representations O\+H\+LC (Open-\/\+High-\/\+Low-\/\+Close) bars and Candlesticks can be set via set\+Chart\+Style.

The data is passed via set\+Data as a set of open/high/low/close values at certain keys (typically times). This means the data must be already binned appropriately. If data is only available as a series of values (e.\+g. {\itshape price} against {\itshape time}), you can use the static convenience function time\+Series\+To\+Ohlc to generate binned O\+H\+L\+C-\/data which can then be passed to set\+Data.

The width of the O\+H\+LC bars/candlesticks can be controlled with set\+Width and set\+Width\+Type. A typical choice is to set the width type to wt\+Plot\+Coords (the default) and the width to (or slightly less than) one time bin interval width.\hypertarget{class_q_c_p_financial_qcpfinancial-appearance}{}\subsection{Changing the appearance}\label{class_q_c_p_financial_qcpfinancial-appearance}
Charts can be either single-\/ or two-\/colored (set\+Two\+Colored). If set to be single-\/colored, lines are drawn with the plottable\textquotesingle{}s pen (set\+Pen) and fills with the brush (set\+Brush).

If set to two-\/colored, positive changes of the value during an interval ({\itshape close} $>$= {\itshape open}) are represented with a different pen and brush than negative changes ({\itshape close} $<$ {\itshape open}). These can be configured with set\+Pen\+Positive, set\+Pen\+Negative, set\+Brush\+Positive, and set\+Brush\+Negative. In two-\/colored mode, the normal plottable pen/brush is ignored. Upon selection however, the normal selected pen/brush (provided by the selection\+Decorator) is used, irrespective of whether the chart is single-\/ or two-\/colored.\hypertarget{class_q_c_p_financial_qcpfinancial-usage}{}\subsection{Usage}\label{class_q_c_p_financial_qcpfinancial-usage}
Like all data representing objects in \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}}, the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_financial}{Q\+C\+P\+Financial}} is a plottable (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_abstract_plottable}{Q\+C\+P\+Abstract\+Plottable}}). So the plottable-\/interface of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} applies (Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::plottable, Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::remove\+Plottable, etc.)

Usually, you first create an instance\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
which registers it with the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} instance of the passed axes. Note that this \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} instance takes ownership of the plottable, so do not delete it manually but use Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::remove\+Plottable() instead. The newly created plottable can be modified, e.\+g.\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
Here we have used the static helper method time\+Series\+To\+Ohlc, to turn a time-\/price data series into a 24-\/hour binned open-\/high-\/low-\/close data series as \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_financial}{Q\+C\+P\+Financial}} uses. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
