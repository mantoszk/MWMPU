An arbitrary pixmap.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
An arbitrary pixmap. 

 It has two positions, {\itshape top\+Left} and {\itshape bottom\+Right}, which define the rectangle the pixmap will be drawn in. Depending on the scale setting (set\+Scaled), the pixmap will be either scaled to fit the rectangle or be drawn aligned to the top\+Left position.

If scaling is enabled and {\itshape top\+Left} is further to the bottom/right than {\itshape bottom\+Right} (as shown on the right side of the example image), the pixmap will be flipped in the respective orientations. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
