Represents two doubles as a mathematical 2D vector.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Represents two doubles as a mathematical 2D vector. 

This class acts as a replacement for Q\+Vector2D with the advantage of double precision instead of single, and some convenience methods tailored for the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} library. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
