A bracket for referencing/highlighting certain parts in the plot.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
A bracket for referencing/highlighting certain parts in the plot. 

 It has two positions, {\itshape left} and {\itshape right}, which define the span of the bracket. If {\itshape left} is actually farther to the left than {\itshape right}, the bracket is opened to the bottom, as shown in the example image.

The bracket supports multiple styles via set\+Style. The length, i.\+e. how far the bracket stretches away from the embraced span, can be controlled with set\+Length.

It provides an anchor {\itshape center}, to allow connection of other items, e.\+g. an arrow (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_item_line}{Q\+C\+P\+Item\+Line}} or \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_item_curve}{Q\+C\+P\+Item\+Curve}}) or a text label (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_item_text}{Q\+C\+P\+Item\+Text}}), to the bracket.
