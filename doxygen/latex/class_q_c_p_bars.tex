A plottable representing a bar chart in a plot.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
A plottable representing a bar chart in a plot. 



To plot data, assign it with the set\+Data or add\+Data functions.\hypertarget{class_q_c_p_bars_qcpbars-appearance}{}\subsection{Changing the appearance}\label{class_q_c_p_bars_qcpbars-appearance}
The appearance of the bars is determined by the pen and the brush (set\+Pen, set\+Brush). The width of the individual bars can be controlled with set\+Width\+Type and set\+Width.

Bar charts are stackable. This means, two \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_bars}{Q\+C\+P\+Bars}} plottables can be placed on top of each other (see Q\+C\+P\+Bars\+::move\+Above). So when two bars are at the same key position, they will appear stacked.

If you would like to group multiple \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_bars}{Q\+C\+P\+Bars}} plottables together so they appear side by side as shown below, use \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_bars_group}{Q\+C\+P\+Bars\+Group}}.

\hypertarget{class_q_c_p_bars_qcpbars-usage}{}\subsection{Usage}\label{class_q_c_p_bars_qcpbars-usage}
Like all data representing objects in \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}}, the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_bars}{Q\+C\+P\+Bars}} is a plottable (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_abstract_plottable}{Q\+C\+P\+Abstract\+Plottable}}). So the plottable-\/interface of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} applies (Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::plottable, Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::remove\+Plottable, etc.)

Usually, you first create an instance\+: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
which registers it with the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} instance of the passed axes. Note that this \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} instance takes ownership of the plottable, so do not delete it manually but use Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::remove\+Plottable() instead. The newly created plottable can be modified, e.\+g.\+: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}
\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
