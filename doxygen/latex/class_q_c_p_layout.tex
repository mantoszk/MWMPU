The abstract base class for layouts.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
The abstract base class for layouts. 

This is an abstract base class for layout elements whose main purpose is to define the position and size of other child layout elements. In most cases, layouts don\textquotesingle{}t draw anything themselves (but there are exceptions to this, e.\+g. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_legend}{Q\+C\+P\+Legend}}).

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout}} derives from \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout_element}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Element}}, and thus can itself be nested in other layouts.

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout}} introduces a common interface for accessing and manipulating the child elements. Those functions are most notably element\+Count, element\+At, take\+At, take, simplify, remove\+At, remove and clear. Individual subclasses may add more functions to this interface which are more specialized to the form of the layout. For example, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout_grid}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Grid}} adds functions that take row and column indices to access cells of the layout grid more conveniently.

Since this is an abstract base class, you can\textquotesingle{}t instantiate it directly. Rather use one of its subclasses like \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout_grid}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Grid}} or \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout_inset}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Inset}}.
