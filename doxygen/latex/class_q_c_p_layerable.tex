Base class for all drawable objects.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
Base class for all drawable objects. 

This is the abstract base class most visible objects derive from, e.\+g. plottables, axes, grid etc.

Every layerable is on a layer (\mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layer}{Q\+C\+P\+Layer}}) which allows controlling the rendering order by stacking the layers accordingly.

For details about the layering mechanism, see the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layer}{Q\+C\+P\+Layer}} documentation. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
cpp/\mbox{\hyperlink{qcustomplot_8cpp}{qcustomplot.\+cpp}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
