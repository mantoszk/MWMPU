The abstract base class for all objects that form the layout system.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
The abstract base class for all objects that form the layout system. 

This is an abstract base class. As such, it can\textquotesingle{}t be instantiated directly, rather use one of its subclasses.

A Layout element is a rectangular object which can be placed in layouts. It has an outer rect (Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Element\+::outer\+Rect) and an inner rect (Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Element\+::rect). The difference between outer and inner rect is called its margin. The margin can either be set to automatic or manual (set\+Auto\+Margins) on a per-\/side basis. If a side is set to manual, that margin can be set explicitly with set\+Margins and will stay fixed at that value. If it\textquotesingle{}s set to automatic, the layout element subclass will control the value itself (via calculate\+Auto\+Margin).

Layout elements can be placed in layouts (base class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout}}) like \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout_grid}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Grid}}. The top level layout is reachable via Q\+Custom\+Plot\+::plot\+Layout, and is a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout_grid}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Grid}}. Since \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout}} itself derives from \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout_element}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Element}}, layouts can be nested.

Thus in \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_custom_plot}{Q\+Custom\+Plot}} one can divide layout elements into two categories\+: The ones that are invisible by themselves, because they don\textquotesingle{}t draw anything. Their only purpose is to manage the position and size of other layout elements. This category of layout elements usually use \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout}} as base class. Then there is the category of layout elements which actually draw something. For example, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_axis_rect}{Q\+C\+P\+Axis\+Rect}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_legend}{Q\+C\+P\+Legend}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_text_element}{Q\+C\+P\+Text\+Element}} are of this category. This does not necessarily mean that the latter category can\textquotesingle{}t have child layout elements. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_legend}{Q\+C\+P\+Legend}} for instance, actually derives from \mbox{\hyperlink{class_q_c_p_layout_grid}{Q\+C\+P\+Layout\+Grid}} and the individual legend items are child layout elements in the grid layout.
